	<h2> Megan Morris </h2>
	<p> I am a 25 year old from London, Ont. I have a 4 year BA in Fine Arts and Psychology. I have lived in Victoria, BC. Vancouver BC, Toronto ON, Chicago IL, and Los Angeles CA. I worked for a travelling circus for a year. My hobbies include Fine arts, poetry, horses, and running. Few fun facts: I don’t have a tailbone, I own a 11 year old stallion named Redino from Spain. </p>

	<h2> Claire Sykes </h2>
    <p>I’m a 25 year woman from the middle of nowhere, Ontario. I grew up in a small farm town called Ailsa Craig; just half an hour outside of London. I’ve travelled to 15 countries and look forward to continuing discovering new places. In my spare time I like to hike, paint and playing video games. </p>
